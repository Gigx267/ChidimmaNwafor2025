Chidimma Nwafor (b. 1995) is a Nigerian visual artist born in Anambra, Nigeria. 
Her artistry delves into the societal stereotypes impacting women and the subtle intricacies of human emotion. 
Through her paintings, characterized by muted and dark color palettes inspired by the Baroque movement, 
she challenges and questions gender stereotypes and societal expectations. Nwafor holds a Bachelor of
Arts degree in Fine Arts from the University of Benin. Currently based in Lagos, Nigeria,
she works as a full-time artist, exploring and reflecting upon these themes in her compelling artwork.
Venturing beyond the surface, I explore the intricate relationship between societal stereotypes and the unconscious mind.
I am fascinated by how deeply ingrained societal norms and expectations seep into our subconscious, shaping our beliefs, perceptions, and self-conceptions.
Drawing from the realm of the unconscious mind, I delve into the hidden desires, fears, and fantasies that manifest in our dreams, thoughts, and creative expressions.
I am intrigued by the ways in which we create alternate realities and narratives as a means of coping with and navigating the complexities of life, 
often influenced and constrained by societal stereotypes and expectations.
